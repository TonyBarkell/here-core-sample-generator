# HERE Core Container Sample Generator - PoC

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Develop a standardized prompt that reliably generates runnable HERE Core Container samples for support scenarios.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Goals
- Understand what information AI needs to succeed consistently
- Identify patterns in successful vs failed sample generation
- Create foundation for team-wide adoption

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
- **Phase**: Initial PoC testing
- **Success Rate**: TBD
- **Test Cases Completed**: 0/3
- **Information Requirements**: Under research

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Using the Prompt
1. Copy prompt from `poc-prompt.md`
2. Replace [DESCRIBE_WHAT_THE_SAMPLE_SHOULD_DEMONSTRATE] with your requirement
3. Run with Claude or similar AI
4. Test generated sample
5. Document results in `results-log.md`

### Testing a Generated Sample
1. Copy generated files to local directory
2. Run setup script provided by AI
3. Launch HERE Core Container with generated manifest
4. Verify functionality works as expected

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics
- **Generation Success**: Does AI create all required files?
- **Functional Success**: Does the sample run without errors?
- **Requirement Match**: Does it demonstrate what was requested?

## ðŸ”„ Iteration Process
1. Test â†’ Document â†’ Analyze â†’ Improve â†’ Repeat
